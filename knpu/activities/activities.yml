ch1_print_string:
    question: |
        Welcome to your first PHP activity! Follow the instructions below and hit submit to
        see how you did! You can press 'skip' or 'next' to continue on to the rest of the tutorial.
        
        Use PHP to print out the string "Hello world" between the `<h1>` and `</h1>` tags
    worker: php
    entry_point: index.php
    skeletons: { index.php: shared/index.php }
    asserts: ch1/Print/PrintStringSuite.php

ch1_set_var:
    question: |
        Now it's your turn to create a variable! Remove your 'Hello world' inside the h1 tag and replace it with a variable called `$pageTitle` and set it to the string "Hello World".
    skeletons: { index.php: shared/index.php }
    worker: php
    entry_point: index.php
    asserts: ch1/SetVar/SetVarSuite.php

ch1_set_var_pupcount:
    question: |
        Time to count your pups! Create a second variable called `$pupCount` and set it to the number 50. Then create and print this inside a `<div class="count">` element.
    skeletons: { index.php: ch1/SetVarPupCount/index.php }
    worker: php
    entry_point: index.php
    asserts: ch1/SetVarPupCount/Test.php

ch2_rand_function:
    # duplication with index.php skeleton and Test between this and the previous activity
    question: |
        Give it a try! Use the `rand()` function to get a random number between 10 and 20 and assign it to the `$pupCount` variable.
    skeletons: { index.php: ch2/rand/index.php }
    worker: php
    entry_point: index.php
    asserts: ch2/rand/Test.php

ch2_trim_whitespace:
    question: |
        In the code below, we're printing a string that has some empty space on both sides. Without changing the string,
        use the `trim` function to remove those spaces before printing so that the `h1` tag has no spaces
        (`<h1>No Spaces!</h1>`).
    skeletons: { index.php: ch2/trim/index.php }
    worker: php
    entry_point: index.php
    asserts: ch2/trim/Test.php

ch2_two_string_functions:
    question: |
        Now a hard one! Let's use 2 functions at once. First, we'll use a new function:
        `strip_tags`. This removes any HTML elements from a string. For example, `Hello <span>World</span>` would
          just be "Hello World" if we passed it as an argument to `strip_tags`.

        First, use `strip_tags` to remove the HTML from the `$comment` variable. Then, print out its length inside the
        `<div class="comment-length"></div>` element using the `strlen` method.
    skeletons: { index.php: ch2/two_string_functions/index.php }
    worker: php
    entry_point: index.php
    asserts: ch2/two_string_functions/Test.php

ch3_basic_array_strings:
    question: |
        Some of my favorite things are listed below in the 3 `<li>` tags. Unfortunately, needing to write `<li class="my-favorite">`
        3 times is a bit wasteful. Create an array, put the 3 strings into it (`ice cream`, `high-fives` and `vacation`),
        and re-render the 3 `<li>` tags dynamically by using a `foreach` statement.
    skeletons: { index.php: ch3/basic_array_strings/index.php }
    worker: php
    entry_point: index.php
    asserts: ch3/basic_array_strings/Test.php

ch3_print_array_key:
    question: |
        Using the same array of favorite things as before, print out *only* the second item (high-fives) in the new
        `.second-thing` div.
    skeletons: { index.php: ch3/print_array_key/index.php }
    worker: php
    entry_point: index.php
    asserts: ch3/print_array_key/Test.php

ch4_associative_array_print:
    question: |
        Let's create our first associative array! Change the array so that Pancake's name is assigned to a `name` key
        and his age to a `age` key. Once you've done that, update the code below so that we're still printing
        out Pancake's information.
    skeletons: { index.php: ch4/associative_array_print/index.php }
    worker: php
    entry_point: index.php
    asserts: ch4/associative_array_print/Test.php
ch4_associative_array_more_items:
    question: |
        We want to tell people what breed Pancake is, so add a `breed` key to our array, set it to "Pug", and print
        it in the `div` with the `pet-breed` class.
    skeletons: { index.php: ch4/associative_array_print/index.php }
    worker: php
    entry_point: index.php
    asserts: ch4/associative_array_more_items/Test.php

ch5_multilevel_arrays:
    question: |
        Let's print our pets! I've already prepared 3 associative arrays and am using them one by one to print out some
        pets! Create a new indexed array called `$pets` and put each of these 3 arrays inside of it. Then, use `foreach`
        to print out the 3 pets, but without the duplication we have right now.
    skeletons: { index.php: ch5/multilevel_arrays/index.php }
    worker: php
    entry_point: index.php
    asserts: ch5/multilevel_arrays/Test.php

ch5_print_multilevel_key:
    question: |
        Now, using the array of pet data, see if you can print Spark Pug's breed into the `.spark-pug-breed` div, using the
        `$pets` variable to access the `breed` key on the second pet:
    skeletons: { index.php: ch5/print_multilevel_key/index.php }
    worker: php
    entry_point: index.php
    asserts: ch5/print_multilevel_key/Test.php

# this is a todo for later
#case_sensitivity_4:
#    question: |
#        Is echo case sensitive (i.e. does ECHO work)? What about variable names - can we set `$pageTitle` and then print
#        `$PAGETITLE`? Does that work? Try it out below to find out.
#    answers:
#        1: Both `echo` and variable names are case *insensitive* (`echo` = `ECHO` and `$pageTitle` = `$PAGETITLE`)
#        2: Both `echo` and variable names are case *sensitive* (`echo` does not equal `ECHO` and `$pageTitle` does not equal `$PAGETITLE`)
#        3: `echo` is case *insensitive* but variables are case *sensitive* (`echo` = `ECHO` but `$pageTitle` does not equal `$PAGETITLE`)
#        4: `echo` is case *sensitive* but variables are case *insensitive* (`echo` does not equal `ECHO` but `$pageTitle` = `$PAGETITLE`)
#    correct: 3
#    correct_message: |
#        Many things in PHP are case insensitive, like `ECHO` or even `<?PHP`. But variables are different: PHP sees `$pageTitle`
#        and `$PAGETITLE` as completely different. But even when things are case insensitive, you'll see us use lowercase
#        (e.g. `echo`) letters so that our code looks consistent with how most developers write.
#    coding:
#        skeletons: { index.php: CaseSensitivity4/index.php }
#        entry_point: index.php
#        worker: php
#        # this is an ungraded coding box
