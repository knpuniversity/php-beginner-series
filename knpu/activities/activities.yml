ch1_print_string:
    question: |
        Welcome to your first PHP activity! Follow the instructions below and hit submit to
        see how you did! You can press 'skip' or 'next' to continue on to the rest of the tutorial
        Use PHP to print out the string "Hello world" between the `<h1>` and `</h1>` tags
    worker: php
    entry_point: index.php
    skeletons: { index.php: shared/index.php }
    asserts: ch1/Print/PrintStringSuite.php

ch1_set_var:
    question: |
        Now it's your turn to create a variable! Remove your 'Hello world' inside the h1 tag and replace it with a variable called `$pageTitle` and set it to the string "Hello World".
    skeletons: { index.php: shared/index.php }
    worker: php
    entry_point: index.php
    asserts: ch1/SetVar/SetVarSuite.php

ch1_set_var_pupcount:
    question: |
        Now create a second variable called `$pupCount` and set it to the number 50. Then print this inside the `<div class="count">` element.
    skeletons: { index.php: ch1/SetVarPupCount/index.php }
    worker: php
    entry_point: index.php
    asserts: ch1/SetVarPupCount/Test.php

ch2_rand_function:
    # duplication with index.php skeleton and Test between this and the previous activity
    question: |
        Use the `rand()` function to get a random number between 10 and 20 and assign it to the `$pupCount` variable.
    skeletons: { index.php: ch2/rand/index.php }
    worker: php
    entry_point: index.php
    asserts: ch2/rand/Test.php

ch2_trim_whitespace:
    question: |
        In the code below, we're printing a string that has some empty space on both sides. Without changing the string,
        use the `trim` function to remove those spaces before printing so that the `h1` tag has no spaces
        (`<h1>No Spaces!</h1>`).
    skeletons: { index.php: ch2/trim/index.php }
    worker: php
    entry_point: index.php
    asserts: ch2/trim/Test.php

ch2_two_string_functions:
    question: |
        Now a hard one! Let's use 2 functions at once. First, we'll use a new function:
        `strip_tags`. This removes any HTML elements from a string. For example, `Hello <span>World</span>` would
          just be "Hello World" if we passed it as an argument to `strip_tags.

        First, use `strip_tags` to remove the HTML from the `$comment` variable. Then, print out its length inside the
        `<div class="comment-length"></div>` element using the `strlen` method.
    skeletons: { index.php: ch2/two_string_functions/index.php }
    worker: php
    entry_point: index.php
    asserts: ch2/two_string_functions/Test.php

# this is a todo for later
#case_sensitivity_4:
#    question: |
#        Is echo case sensitive (i.e. does ECHO work)? What about variable names - can we set `$pageTitle` and then print
#        `$PAGETITLE`? Does that work? Try it out below to find out.
#    answers:
#        1: Both `echo` and variable names are case *insensitive* (`echo` = `ECHO` and `$pageTitle` = `$PAGETITLE`)
#        2: Both `echo` and variable names are case *sensitive* (`echo` does not equal `ECHO` and `$pageTitle` does not equal `$PAGETITLE`)
#        3: `echo` is case *insensitive* but variables are case *sensitive* (`echo` = `ECHO` but `$pageTitle` does not equal `$PAGETITLE`)
#        4: `echo` is case *sensitive* but variables are case *insensitive* (`echo` does not equal `ECHO` but `$pageTitle` = `$PAGETITLE`)
#    correct: 3
#    correct_message: |
#        Many things in PHP are case insensitive, like `ECHO` or even `<?PHP`. But variables are different: PHP sees `$pageTitle`
#        and `$PAGETITLE` as completely different. But even when things are case insensitive, you'll see us use lowercase
#        (e.g. `echo`) letters so that our code looks consistent with how most developers write.
#    coding:
#        skeletons: { index.php: CaseSensitivity4/index.php }
#        entry_point: index.php
#        worker: php
#        # this is an ungraded coding box
